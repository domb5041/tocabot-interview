## Notes

-  all relevant code in src/
   -  App.js
   -  components/NodeModal.js
   -  components/NodesList.js
-  all the data is stored in browser local storage
-  create nodes
-  name them
-  delete nodes
-  connect them together (sort of) ...very basic and unfinished
   -  to connect:
   -  press one connect button then another
-  connections are just represented with text
-  connection feature gets confused if you don't start with the node at the top of list
-  layout is static and uses flexbox, no visual representation of connections
-  react-bootstrap has been used as basis for styling
